# [[Too Much Pain Stops You From Wanting Things|Too Much Pain Stops You From Wanting Things]]

Periods of high negative emotion such as [[Depression|Depression]], [[Anxiety|Anxiety]], Loss, etc usually also come with a paired inability to feel pleasure (called [[Anhedonia]]).

Here's one idea as to why: [[Wanting Something Means Being Disappointed When You Don't Get It|Wanting Something Means Being Disappointed When You Don't Get It]].

Sounds obvious but think about it for a second. Opening yourself up to feel good about something is _necessarily_ paired with becoming vulnerable to the pain of loss if it doesn't work out, or goes away.

Imagining you have two tanks, representing your capacities for pain and joy.

What happens if the joy tank overflows? Well, a [[Manic]] episode I guess, but essentially not much.
What happens if the pain tank overflows? **Death**, maybe. Too much grief can kill people.

>[!warning] This is one of the reasons [[Pain Is Stronger Than Pleasure|Pain Is Stronger Than Pleasure]]. Too much pain is a _lot_ worse than too much pleasure.

Wanting something means taking a gamble on the outcome. Even if the odds are pretty good, there's always a _chance_. 

We've probably all seen this or experienced this when someone is a state of grief. Just something small going wrong sets them off in a crying fit. 
They aren't crazy for crying about being out of milk, it's just the straw that broke the camel's back.

If i'm on the edge of emotional bankruptcy, better not take the risk of a complete breakdown.
But that also means no potential for winnings. No potential for joy. [[That path leads ever down into stagnation|That path leads ever down into stagnation]].

Ultimately, high-pain states are a [[Lose Lose Scenario]]. They just suck. Try [[Dealing with pain|Dealing with pain]] as much and as quickly as you can. Get out of there. Prolonged periods of intolerable pain can and will kill you.

You need to take the gamble of wanting things, which means you need the [[table stakes]] of emotional capacity required to buy a seat at the table.

**It'll get better as you start to remove the sources of pain.**

Removing pain will cause a feedback loop. Increasing your pain tolerance will allow you to begin taking on gambles again, and [[The Winner Effect|The Winner Effect]] of the pleasure it brings will reduce pain and create further motivation to keep improving things and keep removing pain.
