- [Your Theme - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE&embeds_loader_url_for_pings=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVtbm90ZS5jb20v&embeds_origin=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title)

Instead of setting a highly granular goal like "run one mile every day", you set a much larger theme like _order, adventure,_ or _branching out_. 
This theme gives you enough room to find your own goals, interests, and solutions within it. 
It allows for your focus to change when you learn what's important and workable, while still making sure you have some domain to focus in. 
**Themes allow for choice**.
