# [[How Seth Goden Writes A Book|How Seth Goden Writes a Book]]

[[Seth Goden]]'s book [[The Practice|The Practice]] follows a simple structure: Each section has a sequential number, and lasts about a page. 

![[../assets/images/Pasted image 20230502174006.png|Pasted image 20230502174006.png]]

Looking at these sections we notice something: He's consistent.

- #7 - 14 sentences, 150 words
- #8 - 14 sentences, 203 words
- #9 - 15 sentences, 200 words + a quoted paragraph
- #10 - 12 sentences, 172 words

True to form, Seth practices what he preaches. His blog is one idea, written every day. It's The Practice that he talks about in this book, and clearly seems to be the one used to write it as well.

There are a total of 219 of these sections in the book, and the book is 271 pages long (only 52 more). Those 52 pages contain things like the cover pages, dedications, table of contents, and glossary. 

So we could argue the actual content of the book follows a rough structure of one idea per page.

Each of these ideas is short & atomic enough that they could have been a tweet, but people still paid for the book because [[You Pay For The Linear Walkthrough Of The Graph|You Pay For The Linear Walkthrough Of The Graph]].
