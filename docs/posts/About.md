# [[About|About]]

Hi, I’m **Samuel Cochrane** 👋 ,  

I'd describe myself as an intelligence developer. 
Sometimes that means transforming and extracting raw data to make it useable for [[business intelligence]].
Sometimes that means working directly with people to understand their problems and come up with practical solutions as a [[Sales Engineer|Sales Engineer]]. 
It often means staring out of a window with my [[head in the clouds]].

Right now, I’m working on:
- Practical uses for [[GPT|GPT]] and [[Stable Diffusion|Stable Diffusion]].
- Learning [[D&D|D&D]]. 🧙‍♂️
- My current [[Yearly Theme|Yearly Theme]].

Always seeking an opportunity to make things better.
