# [[Pages and Notes Structure|Pages and Notes Structure]]

A [[model|model]] for how to structure a [[Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]].

- Note = content. Long descriptive title that explains its core idea, short in length (a few paragraphs), covering one core idea.

- Page = Skeleton. Links to content, but no content itself. Just a scaffold to plug things into. Think: the table of contents.

A page is the skill-tree. Notes are the skills.

Pages will end up looking quite long (they can be entire books), but under the hood are quite small - just scaffolding with embeds to the actual content.

Pages can be top-down (like a Table Of Contents for a book), or they can represent a  [[Random Walk Through A Graph|Random Walk Through A Graph]]. Maybe just clicking through eight random notes via backlinks and references creates a interesting narrative which deserves to be its own page.
