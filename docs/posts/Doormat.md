# [[Doormat|Doormat]]

Being a doormat goes beyond just being an [[Obliger]] who wants to help, or being [[Non-Preferential]] and going with the flow.

A doormat _has_ preferences, and _doesn't speak up_ about those preferences. A doormat is characterized by Self-negation. 

Doormats are, unsurprisingly, very [[Resentful]]. Not that they'd let anyone know.

### Why Do You Act like a Doormat?

>[!important] Doormating is a way of [[Dealing with pain|Dealing with pain]].

A [[Slave|Slave]] will have an easier life as a doormat. If they push back against the things that cause them pain, they get even more pain. Better to just shut up and take it.

Doormating is a form of [[learned helplessness]] caused by scenarios where speaking up and pushing back didn't fix anything, and in fact only made things worse. [[Pain Is Stronger Than Pleasure|Pain Is Stronger Than Pleasure]].

Doormats will often act as caretakers, ignoring their own needs to serve others. If the guy with a whip has a problem, it's your problem. Make him happy first, _then_ you can deal with yourself.

### How Do You Stop?

If Doormating is a way of dealing with a painful environment, then it can be solved by getting out of that environment.

Remove tyrants and [[Lose Lose Scenario]]s. Find people and roles that respect your choices. 

Slowly, regain your [[Locus Of Control]] & Self-Efficacy. 

Doormats [[How To Know What You Want|Know What They Want]], but need to practice _listening_ to that little voice.

Security is critical. You must know that you can survive the pain that comes with standing up for yourself. [[Confidence is an Abundance Mentality|Confidence is an Abundance Mentality]]. It's hard to stand up to a boss if you have nothing in savings.
