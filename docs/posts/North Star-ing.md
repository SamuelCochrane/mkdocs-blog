> Nothing contributes so much to tranquilize the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.

You can only [[Begin With The End In Mind]] if you know what it is.
North Star-ing, also called 5 Whys, can be a helpful exercise to remember the ultimate [[goal|goal]].

Like a kid, keep asking Why. _Why should I care?_
Usually, you will find a way to connect it to larger goals and higher ideas.

>[!example]- Example: Homework
>1. Why should I do this homework? Because it will help you pass this class.
>2. Why should I pass this class? Because it will help you get your degree.
>3. Why should I get my degree? Because it will help you get a  good job.
>4. Why should I get a job? Because it will help you start your foundation.
>5. Why should I starting my foundation? Because it will help you change the world.
