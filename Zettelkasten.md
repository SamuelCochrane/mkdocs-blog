# [[Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]]

A form of "Hypertextual note taking", where [[Atomic Notes|Atomic Notes]] representing small ideas ([[meme|memes]]) become highly interrelated through ample references, links, and embeds.

Modeled after the human brain, (or rather, a [[model|model]] of the human brain), in which densely interconnected neurons become [[more than the sum of their parts]].

### Core Idea

- Human friendly
	-   connects nodes together the way our brain connects ideas together.
	-   Ideas are not a singular monolithic entity, they're a series of interconnected dots.
- [[Non-Hierarchical Network|Non-Hierarchical Network]]
	- makes content more discoverable & flexible.
- Links & Backlinks

### Outlining Tools

- Some [[Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] tools (like [[RemNote]], but not [[Obsidian|Obsidian]]) are outlining tools.
- These tools focus on block-level links instead of file-level links. For outliners, each bullet-point is its own entity. 
- The creators of [[Obsidian|Obsidian]] have stated it is not an outliner. They have created a similar product, [[Dynalist]], for this reason.
